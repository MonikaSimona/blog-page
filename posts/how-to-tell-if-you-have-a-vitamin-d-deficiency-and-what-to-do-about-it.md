[Vitamin D](https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/vitamin-d) is one of the most common deficiencies in the UK, with the [NHS suggesting that one in five of us have low levels of the nutrient](https://www.nhs.uk/news/food-and-diet/the-new-guidelines-on-vitamin-d-what-you-need-to-know/). Because we get it from the sun, the past lockdown measures have meant that we’ve been spending even less time in natural sunlight than usual.

Even more concerning is that conditions associated with a lack of [vitamin D](https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/vitamin-d-how-to-get-from-sun/491745) are reportedly on the up. And this includes diseases that were once eradicated from the UK, such as rickets. 

However, it’s not all bad news. A 2020 [Medichecks study found](https://medichecks.com/pages/guide-to-vitamin-d) that nearly two-thirds of Brits tested during lockdown had good levels of the vitamin, a 10% improvement on the previous year.

How can we ensure that we keep getting enough of the [sunshine vitamin](https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/sunlight-health-benefits-vitamin-d-serotonin-sun-exposure/372254)?
