Here’s a puzzle: A home-cooked meal is often most beneficial on nights when you’re extremely hungry and just don’t feel like cooking.

I’ve had, um, experience with this conundrum. As a food writer and the author of [I Dream of Dinner](https://bookshop.org/books/i-dream-of-dinner-so-you-don-t-have-to-low-effort-high-reward-recipes-a-cookbook/9780593232514), I spend all day creating recipes, so I don’t always want to keep cooking once I’m off work. There’s a catalog of dishes, though, I know I can pull off no matter what. They’re not always brilliant, and they don’t always include a vegetable, and that’s okay: They get me to bed with warm food in my belly, which is something to be grateful for every single day. I think of these easy meals in three main categories:

**1. Eggs**

— A fried egg on a potato bun, with a dribble of ketchup and/or hot sauce, is so essential that I sneaked a “recipe” for it into my cookbook.

— Other good eggs-plus-starch combos are [egg tacos](https://cupofjo.com/2019/11/witches-are-coming-lindy-west/) and [fatoot samneh](https://food52.com/recipes/82136-scrambled-eggs-with-toasted-pita-recipe).

— Eggs scrambled in the pan with a fork, plus cured meat (salami, bacon, chorizo), a vegetable, or cheese if the cutting board’s already out.

— A bowl of jarred pasta sauce warmed in the microwave and topped with a fried egg scratches a similar itch to shakshuka.

— Leftovers with a fried egg on top. Somehow a fried egg turns hodgepodge into a meal; it’s not science, but it’s proven.

**2. Toast and Friends**

— My mom, the best cook I know, has her own arsenal of default meals. My favorite growing up was a big arugula salad, tossed with lemon juice and olive oil, plus blue cheese toasts: Slice crusty bread, top with blue cheese, broil until molten. In my cookbook, this idea morphed into a Buffalo salad with crunchy greens, celery, and a hot sauce dressing (above). The blue cheese toasts remain unaltered.

— [A toastie with cheese and sauerkraut](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023015-cheddar-sauerkraut-toast) (or pickled condiments), kind of like an open-faced grilled cheese.

— Baked flatbreads with cheese and vegetables, made with store-bought flatbread, naan, or pocketless pita.

— A pita pocket, warmed in the toaster or microwave and filled with hummus and whatever crunchy or cooked vegetables are around.

**3. Pantry Diving**

— My boyfriend and I spent the last six months traveling around the country in [an old converted van](https://www.instagram.com/p/CZe56vtu8kY/). Dinnertime challenges were exacerbated by logistics: where we’ll park and sleep that night, what ingredients we have on hand, will I be cooking in the rain/wind/snow. I came to rely on soup mixes; specifically, I’d make Lipton chicken noodle soup or [Shin Ramyun](https://amzn.to/3KSe0Hz) with whatever brassica I had (broccoli, rabe, kale, brussels sprouts) and a beaten egg stirred in (like [stracciatella](https://www.marthastewart.com/349740/stracciatella-soup) or [egg drop soup](https://thewoksoflife.com/egg-drop-soup/)).

— My mom’s “emergency chickpeas” meal from college is more satisfying than you’d expect: drained chickpeas, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and salt.

— [Spaghetti Aglio e Olio](https://food52.com/recipes/41946-pasta-aglio-olio), also known as “Midnight Pasta” because it fulfills that late-night urge for starch, spice, and a slap of garlic.

— Snack dinner: Find one or two sources of protein and a vegetable and you made dinner. (Find [more ideas here](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/dining/easy-no-cook-dinner-recipes.html).)
